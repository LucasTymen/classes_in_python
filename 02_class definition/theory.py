Introduction to Classes
Class

A class is a template for a data type. It describes the kinds of information that class will hold and how a programmer
will interact with that data. Define a class using the class keyword. PEP 8 Style Guide for Python Code recommends
capitalizing the names of classes to make them easier to identify.

class CoolClass:
  pass

In the above example we created a class and named it CoolClass. We used the pass keyword in Python to indicate that the
body of the class was intentionally left blank so we don’t cause an IndentationError. We’ll learn about all the things
we can put in the body of a class in the next few exercises.
Instructions
1.

Define an empty class called Facade. We’ll chip away at it soon!
